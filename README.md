## Experience

### Front-end Developer at Galaxy Media

> March 2019 - January 2020

Building a component-driven web applications using Vue.

**Estars:** An esports gambling website that allows users to connect with a real-time scheduling and results system for video game contests. Utilizing web sockets, results were constantly being updated for the best experience possible.

**BlazeTV:** A streaming service for political vloggers. Like Estars, the content provided needed to be current and always refreshing itself.

**Front-end experience:** VueJS, Nuxt, WebSockets

**Back-end experience:** Wordpress, PHP, NodeJS

### Front-end Developer at GlynnDevins

> August 2018 - March 2019

Responsible for refactoring existing code to enhance application speed as well as code readability. Mostly Wordpress plugins, the projects I work with were built with basic JavaScript/JQuery and CSS. I have migrated these projects to modern build systems using Node, Gulp, and Webpack to utilize Sass and ES6 modules for the JavaScript.

**Act-On Chrome Extension:** An extension that detects Act-On usage and injects helpful shortcut links for leads such as checking email history or composing an email.

**Front-end experience:** vanilla JavaScript and ES6+, VueJS, Node and task runners, Chrome extension development, and exposure to front-end aspects of Wordpress plug-ins

**Back-end experience:** Laravel, Wordpress, PHP

### Lead Technologist at VML

> March 2017 - July 2018

**Electrolux's Endless Aisle:** A kiosk application for retail experiences that influences customers and guides sales staff. I architected this as a Progressive Web APP using AngularJS. The products were read from a JSON file, and the app can run even when the system is offline.

**Electrolux's website redesign:** Leading front-end teams, encouraging best practices, championing my coworkers, and teaching. Always teaching.

Other client projects include **Ford, HomeStreet Bank, and United Rentals**. We worked with extremely tight deadlines, so it was just as important to do our best work as it was to commend those that rose to the occasion.

**Front-end experience:** vanilla JavaScript and ES6+, AngularJS, VueJS, TypeScript, Gulp, Webpack, Node, SCSS, new CSS (Flex, Grid, variables...).

**Back-end framework experience:** AEM (Java, JavaScript), EpiServer (.Net), Drupal (PHP)

### Software Engineer at Epiq Systems

> September 2016 - February 2017 (6 months)

Converting a large .Net application to a mostly front-end web app. Responsibilities consist of migrating UI logic out of the back-end and deciding whether the job is better suited for JavaScript or CSS. Technologies include KnockoutJS, Sass, and .Net with a full Microsoft productivity stack (VisualStudio Team Services)

### Web Developer at Two West

> October 2015 - September 2016 (1 year)

Scaffolding codebases using NPM, Grunt, Bower, and Bootstrap with Sass, implementing best practices/better techniques into legacy code for AngularJS, jQuery, Sass/CSS, and HTML, and upgrading existing markup to use modern HTML5 functionality. The back-end was PHP, so there was also work creating views, models, and controllers.

Examples include componentizing large amounts of code that were previously condensed into a handful of Angular Controllers, minimizing overall code count by putting duplicate functionality into global Services implementing BEM naming conventions to reduce CSS selector counts, migrating HTML elements that utilize form functionality into actual forms and form elements to leverage Angular's built-in validation techniques instead of using custom ng-click methods built on $scope in Controllers.

**fropnt-end experience:** AngularJS, Gulp, Grunt, Node, SCSS, CSS3

**Back-end experience:** PHP

### Web Developer at VML

> July 2014 - October 2015 (1 year 4 months)

Building static and CMS components for enterprise-level websites. Scaffolding websites, project builds, and servers. Implementing BEM naming conventions to streamline code between developers and thin-out CSS selector lengths. Converting old code to best practice jQuery, or even stepping code bases into AngularJS.

**fropnt-end experience:** AngularJS, Grunt, Node, SCSS, CSS3.

**Back-end framework experience:** AEM (Java), SiteCore (.Net), Drupal (PHP)

### Application Development at Allen Press, Inc.

• Utilization of HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, AJAX, and VB.NET for pre-flight applications that allowed customers to identify and fix simple issues before they're charged for that service, and the company saves their operators excessive amounts of time doing tedious, routine work.

### Electronic PrePress at Allen Press, Inc.

> September 2004 - January 2010 (5 years 5 months)

Quality control for the most part, electronic prepresswork is about ensuring client-provided materials are ready-for-press. There's a million ways a document can print incorrectly, especially when the printer is a multi-million dollar, football-field-sized 4-color press.

• Image Pre-Flight: readying customer supplied images for print
• Pre-Press Operations: readying customer supplied journals for print
• Online Publishing: setting printed manuscripts for online publications
• Copyediting: setting customer supplied manuscripts for print

## Personal Projects

### Drawn By Mouse

This was my first blogging project. It was mostly a way to practice my animation and illustration, but it quickly turned into a way to learn coding. It started with CSS stuff but quickly turned into PHP template work, using the WordPress API to alter themes or create full custom ones.

### Very Mint Comics

Once I'd learned some stuff, I started a collaborative web comic with some friends and peers I'd met through Drawn By Mouse. I was able to create custom entry types and build work streams for everyone to contribute using their own comic's aesthetics.
